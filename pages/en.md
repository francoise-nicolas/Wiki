# About

## My story

I had been an agent of the central administration of the Quai d'Orsay for 8 years,
when I [was appointed on merit, to a position at the French Embassy in Western Africa](./promed.md#RAINERI-RAUGEL),
at a time when [Hervé BESANCENOT](./whoswho.md#besanc) was at its head.
I raised doubts about the accounting for the allocation of scholarships under my responsibility, which earned me pressure.

The words of the prosecutor in my [2015 adhesion criminal proceeding](./aplogan.md),
to qualify the attack of 2010 committed by my office colleague,
are "attempted homicide." The judgment mentions a medical certificate of PTSD following this attack;
she kept her job at the embassy in regards to her strong connections in the host country.
This trial was marked by anomalies [whose systemic character are well documented](./denijust.md#jl2014).
The appeal is on hold.

Repatriated against my will, I was professionally sidelined,
which triggered a [cascade of health crises](./promed.md#a999fcb2).
In 2018, [I was terminated](./deregistration.md). In parallel,
the MAE has systematically rejected my requests initiated in 2013,
to be granted [statutory protection](./pf.md). The head of human resources was then [Nathalie LOISEAU](./whoswho.md#loiseau).
A grueling legal battle followed, ending in 2021 with a judgment in my favor on this particular aspect.

In 2019, the newspaper founded by Jean-Paul Sartre, Liberation, published a [fact check of my affair](./medias.md#pezetnicolas),
stating that "no court decision will qualify her as a victim since each woman accuses the other of being at the origin of the aggression..."
My refutation has [registered 700k views](https://twitter.com/FranoiseNicolas/status/1115997608533737475?s=20&t=xx9LpTCg5ZYSiw98wwIkgA).

## Whistleblower

Whistleblower protection has been an active legislative topic in the EU/France in recent years.
I [reported to several parties](./influence.md), that the [ombudsman](./contrepouvoirs.md#ddd) had systematically whitewashed the MFA in the context of 5 requests initiated in 2012.
The new bill transposing European law,
sponsored by [Sylvain WASERMAN](./whoswho.md#waserm),
gives that entity enhanced powers.
In 2020, the same daily that I quoted [hailed Jacques TOUBON, “a serendipitous ombudsman”](./whoswho.md#toubon).

[Corruption](./corruption.md) is a literary genre in its own right. With a few notable exceptions, it has a blind spot: [rigged courts](./robenoire.md). In this area, this wiki focuses on the [Elf affair](./elf.md) which made [Eva JOLY](./whoswho.md#joly) an icon, and [that of the Carlton][. /carlton.md) implicating the ex-IMF chief. For those who don't know what to think, [Sarkozy's fate](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/world/europe/france-sarkozy-trial-guilty.html) after the presidential election should help them.

This wiki is also interested in the [police state](./etatpolicier.md), [denials of justice](./denijust.md), commonplace but silenced by opinion makers, and the [ capture of the state](./capturetat.md) behind the greatest fortunes of France.

The red caps (2014), the yellow vests (2018-2019), and the zadists (1968-2018),
have in common [the occupation, and the capitulation of the state](./democralter.md#lecoq2018projects).
However, this does not disturb the ruling class' deception of the masses.
Faced with "no crisis should go to waste", [alternative democracy] (./democralter.md) already looks hackneyed.
There remains the path chosen by this wiki: [to get out of one's sucker's position](./robenoire.md#carage2015demontg).
 
## Other
I am from Saint-Malo where ["A Summer's Tale"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/) was filmed, and a single mother of an only child since adulthood. In [1986](../pieces/identifier/829cbd9) and [1987](../pieces/identifier/b5b09b6e) I was awarded prestigious prizes for my thesis work on space law. In 2017, I was [substitute candidate](http://www.nantes-infos.fr/legislatives-1ere-circonscription-de-la-loire-atlantique-christophe-le-tallec-et-francoise-nicolas-candidats -de-la-france-insoumise-3-5-137.html) to represent a constituency of Nantes in the National Assembly, on a [France Insoumise](https://twitter.com/FranceInsoumise) platform.
