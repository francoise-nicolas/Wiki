# About

For the French audience, "the whistleblower that accuses [Nathalie LOISEAU](https://twitter.com/nathalieloiseau)",
suffices to pinpoint me.
For the Anglosphere, here's an introduction.

## Story

It begins in 2008 with a [merit based appointment in Western Africa](./pieces/82f04043/82f04043.pdf) as a MFA agent of 8 years.
In this context, [Hervé BESANCENOT](https://www.whoswho.fr/bio/herve-besancenot_57889) was the person in charge. 
I raised concern about shoddy accounting in the attribution of grants under my responsibility, and things went from bad to worse.

The terms of the prosecutor in my 2015 [criminal (adhesion) procedure](./demarches/aplogan.md), 
to qualify the 2010 attack commited by my office-mate, 
are ‘homicide attempt’. The judgment certifiably establishes I’ve had PTSD from this attack;
she kept her job at the embassy in consideration of her connection with host country’s establishment
(which the French state openly admits in court documents). 
This procedure was marked by inconsistencies in line with [well documented practices](./vp/denijust.md#jl2014). 
The appeal is pending. 

Rapatried against my will, I faced professional sidelining,
triggering a [cascade of mental health crises](./demarches/autre.md#a999fcb2),
and [was terminated in 2018](./demarches/radiation.md). In parallel, 
the MFA pushbacked against my 2013 demand for [“protection fonctionnelle”](./demarches/pf.md). It was then Nathalie LOISEAU, the person in charge.
A long legal battle followed, ending in 2021 with my vindication (on paper, wait and see) for that particular aspect. 

In 2019, the newspaper founded by Jean-Paul Sartre, Libération, published a [fact-check of my story](./demarches/medias.md#pezetnicolas)
underscoring the fact that "no court decision will qualify her as a victim since each woman accuses the other of being at the origin of the aggression"...

## Advocacy

Whistleblower protection has been a hot legislative topic in the EU/France in the last few years. 
I [reached out to several parties](./demarches/influence.md) to express my concern about the ombudsman ([Défenseur des Droits](https://twitter.com/Defenseurdroits)), 
that it whitewashed the MFA in the context of 5 requests, beginning in 2012. 
The new bill transposing EU law, sponsored by [Sylvain WASERMAN](https://twitter.com/SylvainWaserman), grants it reinforced powers. 
In 2020, the same daily newspaper that I cited [lauded the ombudsman](./vp/parlement.md#touboninesp).

<!--
[French corruption](./vp/corruption.md) is a literary genre of its own. But with notable authoritative exceptions, it has a blindspot: the courts. His entire life, 
a French citizen is told: "when a politician is sentenced, it's good/bad for democracy" depending on whether [a judge](./vp/corruption.md#joly2021revolue) or a politician is speaking. But sentences rarely carry through to judgments of last resort: they're propaganda that go by the name of [_game of appearances_](vp/corruption.md#japparences). Featured in this Wiki are the [Elf affair](./vp/elf.md) that made [Eva Joly](https://twitter.com/EvaJoly) iconic, and the sensational [Carlton affair](./vp/carlton.md). For those unsure what to believe, [Sarkozy's fate](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/world/europe/france-sarkozy-trial-guilty.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist) post presidential election is a must-watch. 

"France is not in Chaos" told [Nathalie LOISEAU to "DW's Conflit Zone" in 2020](https://www.dw.com/en/mep-nathalie-loiseau-france-is-not-in-chaos/a-52083156). The red caps (2014), the yellow vests (2018-2019), and the zadists (1968-2018),
have in common [low intensity warfare, and the state backing off](./vp/democralter.md#lecoq2018projects).
But that hasn't disturbed institutionalized deception towards the masses.
Faced with "no crisis should go to waste", [alternative democracy](./vp/democrater.md) already looks hackneyed.
Thus the aim of this wiki: moving past the stalemate by [getting curious and engaged](./vp/robenoire.md#carage2015demontg).
My role vis à vis NGOs and IGOs is clear: to [incite them](./demarches/influence.md) to join. 
[HRW did its job vis à vis the MFA](./vp/mae.md#HRWfrance), but it has remained under the radar.

I am a native of Saint-Malo, and have been a single mother of one since I'm an adult. In [1986](../pieces/identifiant/829cbd9) and [1987](../pieces/identifiant/b5b09b6e) two prestigious institutions awarded me prizes for thesis work at the junction between law and space travel. In 2017, I was [suppleant candidate](http://www.nantes-infos.fr/legislatives-1ere-circonscription-de-la-loire-atlantique-christophe-le-tallec-et-francoise-nicolas-candidats-de-la-france-insoumise-3-5-137.html) to represent the 1st constituency of Loire-Atlantique at the [National Assembly](https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/essay/the-national-assembly-of-french-parliament/44269
) on a [France Insoumise](https://twitter.com/FranceInsoumise) platform.
